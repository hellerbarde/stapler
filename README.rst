Stapler
=======

Stapler is a pure Python alternative to
`PDFtk <http://www.pdfhacks.com/pdftk/>`__, a tool for manipulating PDF
documents from the command line.

History
-------

PDFtk was written in Java and C++, and is natively compiled with gcj.
Sadly, it has been discontinued a few years ago and bitrot is setting in
(e.g., it does not compile easily on a number of platforms).

Philip Stark decided to look for an alternative and found pypdf, a PDF
library written in pure Python. He couldn't find a tool which actually
used the library, so he started writing his own.

Version 0.3 of stapler was completely refactored by Fred Wenzel. He also
added tests and awesome functionality.

Like pdftk, stapler is a command-line tool. If you would like to add a
GUI, compile it into a binary for your favorite platform, or contribute
anything else, feel free to fork and send a pull request.

Contributors and Authorship
---------------------------

Stapler version 0.2 was written in 2009 by Philip Stark. Stapler version
0.3 was written in 2010 by Fred Wenzel.

Change log (sorta)
------------------

- **1.0.0** Port to Python 3. Replace OptionParser with more
  modern ArgumentParser. Cleaning up repository.

- **0.3.3** include try-except blocks for supporting legacy pyPdf
  if needed. Also fixes some PyPI issues like the missing License Trove
  classifier and some dependencies.

- **0.3.0** Refactoring by Fred Wenzel and now using PyPDF2

- **0.2.0** Feature completeness using original pyPdf

Usage
-----

There are the following modes in Stapler:

select/delete (called with ``sel`` and ``del``, respectively)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``sel`` is also available as ``cat`` for compatibility with my
personal muscle memory. :)

With select, you can cherry-pick pages from pdfs and concatenate them
into a new pdf file.

Input files can be associated with handles for use with ranges later.
A handle is a single, upper-case letter:

::

    <input handle>=<input>

Syntax:

::

    stapler sel input1 page_or_range [page_or_range ...] [input2 p_o_r ...]

Examples:

::

    # concatenate a and b into output.pdf
    stapler sel a.pdf b.pdf output.pdf

    # generate a pdf file called output.pdf with the following pages:
    # 1, 4-8 in 180째 (D for down), 20-40 from a.pdf, 1-5 from b.pdf in 
    # this order
    stapler sel a.pdf 1 4-8D 20-40 b.pdf 1-5 output.pdf

    # the same example with a handle for b.pdf
    stapler sel B=b.pdf a.pdf 1 4-8D 20-40 B1-5 output.pdf

    # generate a pdf file called output.pdf with the following pages:
    # 1 from a.pdf, 1-5 from b.pdf, 4-8 in 180째 (D for down), 20-40 from a.pdf
    # this order
    stapler sel A=a.pdf B=b.pdf A1 B1-5 A4-8D A20-40 output.pdf

    # reverse some of the pages in a.pdf by specifying a negative range
    stapler sel a.pdf 1-3 9-6 10 output.pdf

The delete command works almost exactly the same as select, but inverse.
It uses the pages and ranges which you *didn't* specify.

split/burst:
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Splits the specified pdf files into their single pages and writes each
page into it's own pdf file with this naming scheme:

::

    ${origname}_${zero-padded page no}.pdf

Syntax:

::

    stapler split input1 [input2 input3 ...]

Example for a file foobar.pdf with 20 pages:

::

    $ stapler split foobar.pdf
    $ ls
    foobar_01.pdf foobar_02.pdf ... foobar_19.pdf foobar_20.pdf

Multiple files can be specified, they will be processed as if you called
single instances of stapler.

zip:
~~~~

With zip, you can cherry-pick pages from pdfs (like select). The pages
from each pdf are merged together in an interleaving manner. This can be
used to collate a pdf with odd pages and a pdf with even pages into a
single file.

Syntax: stapler zip input1 [range[rotation]] [range ...] [input2
[range...] ...] out

Examples:

::

    # combine a pdf with odd pages and a pdf with even pages into output.pdf
    stapler zip odd.pdf even.pdf output.pdf

    # combine a.pdf b.pdf and c.pdf, but use only some pages of c.pdf and
    #  rotate b.pdf right (90째 clockwise) and rotate c.pdf left (90째 counter-
    # clockwise)
    stapler zip a.pdf b.pdf 1-endR c.pdf 1-3L output.pdf

If one of the ranges is shorter than the others, stapler will continue
to merge the remaining pages.

info:
~~~~~

Shows information on the metadata stored inside a PDF file.

Syntax:

::

    stapler info foo.pdf

Example output:

::

    \*\*\* Metadata for foo.pdf

    /ModDate:  D:20100313082451+01'00'
    /CreationDate:  D:20100313082451+01'00'

    /Title:  foo.pdf
    /Creator:  PDFCreator Version 0.9.9
    /Keywords:

    /Subject:

list-logical:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Shows each logical page number and the associated physical page number.

Syntax:

::

    stapler list-logical foo.pdf

Example output:

::

    A-1	1
    C-1	2
    D-1	3
    D-2	4
    D-3	5
    D-4	6
